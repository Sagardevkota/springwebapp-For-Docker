## springwebapp-For-Docker
# There are three approaches to create docker image

* Using the integrated Spring Boot build-image goal
* Using the jib-maven-plugin from Google
* Using the dockerfile-maven-plugin from Spotify

# 1. Using the integrated Spring Boot build-image goal

So with no further code changes necessary, simply run the command

```diff

mvn spring-boot:build-image

```

On Completion you will see

Successsfully built image 'docker.io/library/springwebappdemo:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT

then simply run

docker run --tty --publish 8090:8090 springwebappdemo:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT

Note:You should have your docker terminal running in background..


# 2. Using the jib-maven-plugin from Google

A benefit is that it does not require Docker to be installed locally* which can be useful for Continuous Integration / build server — the jib-maven-plugin will build and push the image straight to the Docker registry of choice

To build the Docker image, run the command

mvn compile com.google.cloud.tools:jib-maven-plugin:2.3.0:dockerBuild

Once built, we can run our new Docker image. docker run -p 9091:8080 -t demo-application:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT

Note:It doesnt require docker to be installed locally but if you have it installed you can see your docker container running by following command

docker ps

You can use following command to stop docker container

docker rm -f CONTAINER_ID


# 3. Using the dockerfile-maven-plugin from Spotify

we need to have a Dockerfile — for the purpose of demonstration there’s a Dockerfile ready-made in the GitHub repository. Add your Dockerfile into your root directory alongside your pom.xml.

Note:I have included Dockerfile in this repo

we will add some configuration into the pom.xml, specifically repository tag and an argument for the JAR_FILE which you can see we reference in the Dockerfile above

<plugin>
  <groupId>com.spotify</groupId>
  <artifactId>dockerfile-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.4.13</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>default</id>
      <goals>
        <goal>build</goal>
        <goal>push</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
  <configuration>
    <repository>${project.artifactId}</repository>
    <tag>${project.version}</tag>
    <buildArgs>
      <JAR_FILE>target/${project.build.finalName}.jar</JAR_FILE>
    </buildArgs>
  </configuration>
</plugin>

Run the standard command mvn package

Once built, we can run our new Docker image. docker run -p 9092:8080 -t demo-application:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
